## Ingredients

- Bacon
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2-1/2 cups cubed potatoes; red or yellow work best
- 2 tablespoons flour, or 1 tablespoon corn starch
- 1 teaspoon instant chicken bouillon granules
- ¼ teaspoon dried, crushed thyme
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 2 cups milk
- 1 cup (or less) light cream or half-and-half
- 2 cups cooked, cubed butternut squash, slightly mashed

## Directions

1. Cook bacon strips

2. Pour a couple of tablespoons bacon drippings (fat) into a large saucepan. Sauté the onions until tender.

3. Add cubed potatoes into saucepan. Add just enough water to almost cover the potatoes. Cook potatoes until just barely tender, about 10 minutes.

4. Combine flour, bouillon granules, thyme and pepper in a bowl. Add milk gradually and stir until smooth. Add entire mixture to saucepan.

5. Cook soup until it simmers. Add butternut squash cubes. Add cream and crumbled bacon. Bring to a simmer again. Turn off immediately. All done!
