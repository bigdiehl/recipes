## Ingredients

- Bacon
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2-1/2 cups cubed potatoes; red or yellow work best
- 2 tablespoons flour, or 1 tablespoon corn starch
- 1 teaspoon instant chicken bouillon granules
- ¼ teaspoon dried, crushed thyme
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 2 cups milk
- 1 cup (or less) light cream or half-and-half
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)
- 2 small cans chopped or minced clams

## Directions

1. Cook bacon strips.

2. Pour a couple of tablespoons bacon drippings (fat) into a large saucepan. Sauté the onions until tender.

3. Drain the clam juice into the saucepan. (Set the clams aside; you’ll add them later.)

4. Add cubed potatoes into saucepan. Add just enough water to almost cover the potatoes. Cook potatoes until just barely tender, about 10 minutes.

5. Combine flour, bouillon granules, thyme and pepper in a bowl. Add milk gradually and stir until smooth. Add entire mixture to saucepan.

6. Cook soup until it simmers. Add cream, Worcestershire sauce, clams and crumbled bacon. Bring to a simmer again. Turn off immediately – you don’t want to overcook the clams. All done!

7. Serve in a bread bowl or serve with hot biscuits.
